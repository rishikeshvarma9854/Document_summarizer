    """Multi-head attention mechanism for document understanding."""
    
    def __init__(self, d_model: int, num_heads: int, dropout: float = 0.1):
        super().__init__()
        assert d_model % num_heads == 0
        
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.d_k = d_model // num_heads
        
        self.w_q = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.w_k = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.w_v = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.w_o = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        
    def scaled_dot_product_attention(self, Q, K, V, mask=None):
        """Compute scaled dot-product attention with optional masking."""
        scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1)) / math.sqrt(self.d_k)
        
        if mask is not None:
            scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, -1e9)
        
        attention_weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
        output = torch.matmul(attention_weights, V)
        return output, attention_weights
```

**T5 Transformer Integration:**
```python
class T5Summarizer:
    """T5-based abstractive summarization with attention mechanisms."""
    
    def __init__(self, model_name: str = "t5-small"):
        self.tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)
        
        # Advanced generation configuration
        self.generation_config = GenerationConfig(
            max_length=150,
            min_length=30,
            length_penalty=2.0,
            num_beams=4,

        )
    
    def generate_summary(self, text: str, max_summary_length: int = 150):
        """Generate abstractive summary using T5 with attention."""
        input_text = f"summarize: {text}"
        
        inputs = self.tokenizer(
            input_text,
            return_tensors="pt",
            max_length=512,
            truncation=True,
            padding=True
        )
        
        with torch.no_grad():
            summary_ids = self.model.generate(
                inputs["input_ids"],
                attention_mask=inputs["attention_mask"],
                generation_config=self.generation_config
            )
        
        return self.tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
```

**Hybrid Ensemble Approach:**
```python
class HybridAbstractiveModel:
    """Ensemble of multiple transformer models for optimal quality."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.t5_model = T5Summarizer("t5-small")
        self.bart_model = BARTSummarizer("facebook/bart-large-cnn")
        self.pegasus_model = PegasusSummarizer("google/pegasus-xsum")
    
    def generate_summary(self, text: str, method: str = "ensemble"):
        """Generate summary using ensemble of transformers."""
        if method == "ensemble":
            # Generate summaries from all models
            t5_summary = self.t5_model.generate_summary(text)
            bart_summary = self.bart_model.generate_summary(text)
            pegasus_summary = self.pegasus_model.generate_summary(text)
            
            # Intelligent ensemble selection based on attention scores
            summaries = [t5_summary, bart_summary, pegasus_summary]
            return self._select_best_summary(summaries, text)
        
        return self.t5_model.generate_summary(text)
```

**Document-Level Attention Mechanism:**
```python
class DocumentAttention(nn.Module):
    """Document-level attention for sentence importance scoring."""
    
    def __init__(self, hidden_size: int, num_layers: int = 2):
        super().__init__()
        self.sentence_encoder = nn.LSTM(
            hidden_size, hidden_size // 2, 
            num_layers=num_layers, 
            bidirectional=True, 
            batch_first=True,
            dropout=0.1
        )
        
        self.attention = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size // 2),
            nn.Tanh(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size // 2, 1)
        )
    
    def forward(self, sentence_embeddings, sentence_mask=None):
        """Apply document-level attention to sentence embeddings."""
        lstm_output, _ = self.sentence_encoder(sentence_embeddings)
        attention_scores = self.attention(lstm_output).squeeze(-1)
        
        if sentence_mask is not None:
            attention_scores = attention_scores.masked_fill(sentence_mask == 0, -1e9)
        
        attention_weights = F.softmax(attention_scores, dim=-1)
        document_representation = torch.sum(
            attention_weights.unsqueeze(-1) * lstm_output, dim=1
        )
        
        return document_representation, attention_weights
