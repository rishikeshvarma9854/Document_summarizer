# 🚀 Deployment Guide for Streamlit Cloud

## 📋 Steps to Enable Transformers on Streamlit Cloud:

### 1. **Add API Key to Streamlit Secrets**
1. Go to your Streamlit Cloud app: https://share.streamlit.io/
2. Click on your app: `smartsummarizer06`
3. Click the **⚙️ Settings** button
4. Go to the **Secrets** tab
5. Add this content:

```toml
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY = "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"
```

6. Click **Save**

### 2. **Restart the App**
1. In the app settings, click **Reboot app**
2. Wait for the app to restart
3. The transformers should now load automatically!

## 🔍 **How to Verify It's Working:**
- When you upload a document, you should see:
  - `🤖 T5 model loaded successfully!` (instead of TextRank fallback)
  - `🤖 Used T5 Transformer for AI-powered summarization`

## 🛠️ **If Still Not Working:**
1. Check the app logs in Streamlit Cloud for any errors
2. Make sure the API key is exactly: `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`
3. Ensure there are no extra spaces or quotes in the secrets

## ✅ **Expected Behavior:**
- **With API Key**: Uses T5 transformer for high-quality summaries
- **Without API Key**: Falls back to TextRank (still works great!)

Your app will work perfectly either way, but transformers provide better quality summaries! 🎉
